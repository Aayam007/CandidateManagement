# JobCandidates

## Overview

The JobCandidates is a .NET-based RESTful service designed to manage candidate information efficiently. This API allows you to add and update candidate profiles, using the candidate's email as a unique identifier. This document provides detailed instructions for setting up the application, configuring settings, managing database migrations, and running tests.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) (version compatible with the project)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or a compatible database server
- Visual Studio or any .NET-compatible IDE

## Configuration

### Updating `appsettings.json`

1. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the **main project**.

2. Locate the `ConnectionStrings` section. It should look something like this:

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;Trusted_Connection=True;"
   }

3. Goto Package Manager Console and set the default project as CandidateManagement.Infrastructure.
4. Run script "Add-Migration "Migration Name".
5. Run Script "Update-Database".

## Improvements

### 1. **CORS Policy**
   - **Issue**: The application currently does not have a CORS policy, which may lead to access issues from different origins.
   - **Improvement**: Implement a CORS policy to allow specific origins, methods, and headers.

### 2. **Error Handling Middleware**
   - **Issue**: There is no centralized error handling mechanism.
   - **Improvement**: Create an `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` to catch exceptions globally and provide standardized error responses.

### 3. **Logging Enhancements**
   - **Issue**: Basic logging is available but lacks structure and flexibility.
   - **Improvement**: Integrate a structured logging library like Serilog for better log management and analysis.

### 4. **Environment-Specific Configuration**
   - **Issue**: Configuration settings are not optimized for different environments.
   - **Improvement**: Use `appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.Production.json`, etc., for environment-specific settings.

### 5. **Health Checks**
   - **Issue**: No health check endpoint is configured.
   - **Improvement**: Implement health checks to monitor application status and improve reliability.

### 6. **Swagger Documentation**
   - **Issue**: Swagger is included but lacks customization.
   - **Improvement**: Enhance Swagger UI to include API versioning and more descriptive documentation.

### 7. **Validation Improvements**
   - **Issue**: Validation logic is minimal.
   - **Improvement**: Implement more detailed validation attributes in the DTOs and consider using FluentValidation for complex scenarios.

### 8. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - **Issue**: No testing framework is integrated.
   - **Improvement**: Set up unit tests for services and repositories and integration tests for controllers to ensure code reliability.

### 9. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Issue**: Potential performance bottlenecks in database operations.
   - **Improvement**: Use asynchronous programming effectively and optimize database queries, including pagination for large datasets.

### 10. **Security Enhancements**
   - **Issue**: Application security practices are not defined.
   - **Improvement**: Implement security measures such as input validation, secure connection strings, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

## Assumptions

1. **Development Environment**: It is assumed that the development is taking place in a local environment with access to necessary tools (e.g., SQL Server, .NET SDK).

2. **Team Collaboration**: It is assumed that the team has established communication and collaboration practices to ensure that everyone is aligned on project goals and tasks.

3. **User Authentication**: It is assumed that user authentication and authorization are handled separately, as the current implementation does not include these aspects.

4. **Database Design**: It is assumed that the database schema is optimized and that all necessary indexes are applied for performance.

5. **Future Requirements**: It is assumed that future requirements may include additional features such as candidate skill sets, application tracking, or user role management.

## Total Time Estimation

The total time for implementing the above improvements and assumptions may vary based on team capacity and familiarity with the technologies. Below is a rough estimate:

- **CORS Policy Implementation**: 2 hours
- **Error Handling Middleware**: 4 hours
- **Logging Integration**: 3 hours
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: 2 hours
- **Health Checks Implementation**: 2 hours
- **Swagger Documentation Enhancement**: 3 hours
- **Validation Improvements**: 3 hours
- **Unit and Integration Testing**: 5 hours
- **Performance Optimization**: 4 hours
- **Security Enhancements**: 4 hour
